![Kaa's Hunting](/images/chapter-3-kaas-hunting-img.jpg)

His spots are the joy of the Leopard: his horns are the 
Buffalo's pride. 
Be clean, for the strength of the hunter is known by the 
gloss of his hide. 
If ye find that the Bullock can toss you, or the heavy-browed 
Sambhur can gore; 
Ye need not stop work to inform us: we knew it ten seasons 
before. 
Oppress not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as Sister 
and Brother, 
For though they are little and fubsy, it may be the Bear is 
their mother. 
"There is none like to me!" says the Cub in the pride of his 
earliest kill; 
But the jungle is large and the Cub he is small. Let him 
think and be still. 
-- Maxims of Baloo

All that is told here happened some time before Mowgli was turned out of the Seeonee Wolf Pack, or revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It was in the days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle. The big, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so quick a pupil, for the young wolves will only learn as much of the Law of the Jungle as applies to their own pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can repeat the Hunting Verse --"Feet that make no noise; eyes that can see in the dark; ears that can hear the winds in their lairs, and sharp white teeth, all these things are the marks of our brothers except Tabaqui the Jackal and the Hyaena whom we hate." But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to learn a great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black Panther would come lounging through the jungle to see how his pet was getting on, and would purr with his head against a tree while Mowgli recited the day's lesson to Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well as he could swim, and swim almost as well as he could run. So Baloo, the Teacher of the Law, taught him the Wood and Water Laws: how to tell a rotten branch from a sound one; how to speak politely to the wild bees when he came upon a hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang the Bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday; and how to warn the water-snakes in the pools before he splashed down among them. None of the Jungle People like being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly at an intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers' Hunting Call, which must be repeated aloud till it is answered, whenever one of the Jungle-People hunts outside his own grounds. It means, translated, "Give me leave to hunt here because I am hungry." And the answer is, "Hunt then for food, but not for pleasure."
