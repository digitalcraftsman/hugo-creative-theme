![Seeonee Pack](/images/chapter-2-hunting-song-of-the-seeonee-pack.jpg)

As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled 
Once, twice and again! 
And a doe leaped up, and a doe leaped up 
From the pond in the wood where the wild deer sup. 
This I, scouting alone, beheld, 
Once, twice and again!

As the dawn was breaking the Sambhur belled 
Once, twice and again! 
And a wolf stole back, and a wolf stole back 
To carry the word to the waiting pack, 
And we sought and we found and we bayed on his track 
Once, twice and again!

As the dawn was breaking the Wolf Pack yelled 
Once, twice and again! 
Feet in the jungle that leave no mark!

Eyes that can see in the dark--the dark! 
Tongue--give tongue to it! Hark! O hark! 
Once, twice and again!
