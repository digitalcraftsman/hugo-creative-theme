THAT HE SANG AT THE COUNCIL ROCK WHEN HE 
DANCED ON SHERE KHAN'S HIDE

The Song of Mowgli--I, Mowgli, am singing. Let the jungle 
listen to the things I have done.

Shere Khan said he would kill--would kill! At the gates in the 
twilight he would kill Mowgli, the Frog!

He ate and he drank. Drink deep, Shere Khan, for when wilt thou 
drink again? Sleep and dream of the kill.

I am alone on the grazing-grounds. Gray Brother, come to me! 
Come to me, Lone Wolf, for there is big game afoot!

Bring up the great bull buffaloes, the blue-skinned herd bulls 
with the angry eyes. Drive them to and fro as I order.

Sleepest thou still, Shere Khan? Wake, oh, wake! Here come I, 
and the bulls are behind.

Rama, the King of the Buffaloes, stamped with his foot. Waters of 
the Waingunga, whither went Shere Khan?

He is not Ikki to dig holes, nor Mao, the Peacock, that he should 
fly. He is not Mang the Bat, to hang in the branches. Little 
bamboos that creak together, tell me where he ran?

Ow! He is there. Ahoo! He is there. Under the feet of Rama 
lies the Lame One! Up, Shere Khan!

Up and kill! Here is meat; break the necks of the bulls!

Hsh! He is asleep. We will not wake him, for his strength is 
very great. The kites have come down to see it. The black 
ants have come up to know it. There is a great assembly in his 
honor.

Alala! I have no cloth to wrap me. The kites will see that I am 
naked. I am ashamed to meet all these people.

Lend me thy coat, Shere Khan. Lend me thy gay striped coat that I 
may go to the Council Rock.
